1. DAO (Data Access Object)
Purpose: The DAO layer handles interactions with the database. It abstracts database queries and provides a clean interface for retrieving, updating, deleting, or inserting data.
Responsibilities: Encapsulate database queries (e.g., using SQLAlchemy models and queries).

2. API
Purpose: This defines the RESTful endpoints for the module, allowing external clients or frontend applications to interact with it.
Responsibilities:
Define HTTP routes (e.g., /api/v1/some_entity).
Handle request parsing and validation (often delegating to schemas).
Call DAO or command functions to execute the necessary logic.
Format and return responses to clients.

3. Schemas
Purpose: Schemas define the structure and validation rules for the data, ensuring that input/output data is correctly formatted and valid.
Responsibilities:
Serialize and deserialize data (e.g., from JSON to Python objects and vice versa).
Enforce validation rules for incoming requests or outgoing responses.
Provide a clear contract for the API's data formats.

4. Commands
Purpose: The command layer encapsulates business logic and use cases. This layer ensures that complex operations are modular and testable.
Responsibilities:
Execute specific tasks or workflows related to the module (e.g., creating an entity, running calculations, or sending notifications).
Enforce business rules and validations.
Call DAOs for database interactions if needed.


5. Benefits of This Architecture
Separation of Concerns: Each component has a distinct responsibility, making it easier to understand and modify.
Scalability: You can add new modules or features without affecting existing ones.
Testability: Commands, DAOs, and APIs can be tested independently.
Maintainability: Encapsulation of logic into modules prevents tightly coupled code.


Example Workflow
If you want to create a new entity:

API Layer: Receives a POST request with JSON payload.
Schemas: Validates and deserializes the payload.
Commands: Executes the business logic to create the entity.
DAO: Interacts with the database to insert the new entity.
API Layer: Formats the response and sends it back to the client.
